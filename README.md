Add Node.js script that prints a message based on the number of command-line arguments passed to it.
This Node.js script prints the first argument passed to it.

- If **no argument** is provided, it prints: `No argument`
- Otherwise, it prints the **first argument**

It uses `console.log(...)` for output and avoids both `var` and `.length`.
